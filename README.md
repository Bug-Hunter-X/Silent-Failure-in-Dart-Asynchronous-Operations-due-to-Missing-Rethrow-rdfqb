# Silent Failure in Dart Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: neglecting to rethrow exceptions caught in `catch` blocks within `async` functions.  This can lead to silent failures where errors are logged, but the calling function doesn't know an error occurred, hindering debugging.

The `bug.dart` file showcases this issue. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`. Observe that the error is logged, but the program doesn't explicitly indicate failure.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart`.  Notice how the exception is properly propagated.
